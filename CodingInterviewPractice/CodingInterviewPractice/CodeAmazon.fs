(*
1) K largest elements from a big file or array.

2) Find a triplet a, b, c such that a2 = b2 + c2. Variations of this problem like find a triplet with sum equal to 0. Find a pair with given sum. All such questions are efficiently solved using hashing. – Practice here

3) Binary tree traversal questions like left view, right view, top view, bottom view, maximum of a level, minimum of a level, children sum property, diameter etc.

4) Convert a Binary tree to DLL – Practice here

5) Lowest Common ancestor in a Binary Search Tree and Binary Tree.

7) Implement a stack with push(), pop() and min() in O(1) time.

8) Reverse a linked list in groups of size k – Practice here

9) Given two numbers represented by two linked lists, write a function that returns sum list – Practice here

10) Rotate a matrix by 90 degree.

11) Stock span problem

12) Next greater element

13) Some Dynamic Programming problems like:
    Maximum sum subarray such that no elements are consecutive – Practice here
    Edit distance
    Assembly line scheduling

14) Why Amazon?

15) Questions about projects done in previous company or final year.
