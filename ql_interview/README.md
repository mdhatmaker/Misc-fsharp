# QUICKEN LOANS INTERVIEW PREP

This code resides in the "ql_interview" folder of the following repo in my
public GitHub:
<https://github.com/mdhatmaker/Misc-fsharp>

## Introduction

This folder contains some sample code that demonstrates using Microsoft's ML.NET machine learning framework. The samples are intended to demonstrate the basic ability to work with this machine learning framework and to provide a potential locus for the interview conversation.

## Description

The majority of my work experience has been at trading firms (high-frequency and otherwise), and my positions most often required me to learn and implement a variety of technologies using several programming languages.

This type of work has taught me to deal with high-pressure environments and high-pressure deadlines. Also, I have often had to be self-sustaining in terms of creating project goals and achieving those goals. That said, I very much enjoy working with a team, especially when those team members are talented (and especially when the technologies involved are F# and ML.NET).

Additionally, I am familiar with a wide variety of financial markets, and I would be able to work with data on Bonds, FX, Futures and Options (just guessing as to what might be relevant to QuickenLoans business domain).

In the few days I had to explore the current state of F# and ML.NET, I was able to try out the Model Builder (very cool) and try out some other ML.NET examples in F# (also very cool, but often with caveats related to updates to the ML.NET framework). For purposes of Model Builder, I included some C# sample code, but I have been focused on reorienting myself with F#, a language which I have been impressed with since its earliest beta releases.

## Conclusion

To reiterate, these sample projects are only intended to demonstrate a basic aptitude with the ML.NET framework. I spent a few days getting reacquainted with F# and exploring the advances Microsoft has made with their ML.NET framework. If this position at QuickenLoans seems like a good fit, I am confident I will be back to full-speed in these technologies in a matter of weeks.
